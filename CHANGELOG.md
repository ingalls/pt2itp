### v11.11.0


- :bug: a call to `turf.linestring` failed when passed a one-coordinate feature. This was the result of a call to `dedup()` which was being passed a two-point line of coordinates that had been truncated enough to be identical. `dedup` removed one of them, producing the error. This case is now detected and handled.
- :bug: `split.js` was producing weird errors related to `proc.c` and `InitProcess`. This looked like postgres connection exhaustion. Initially I implemented a system for calling the postgres pool shutdown function. That code remains in place (it's good hygiene!) but was not the issue: instead, the split.js parallelism based on CPU count was the culprit, as each child process instantiated its own postgres connection pool and I was on a 64 core ECS container. Capping the total number of child processes to 16 is inelegant but seems to do the trick.

### v11.10.1

- :rocket: :white_check_mark: Remove the `1/2` from numbers - numbers are deduped if they already exist in the non-`1/2` form.

- :rocket: Zoom to map bounds on first open of debug

### v11.1.0

- :rocket: uses the callback functionality of `process.stdout.write` to throttle writing so that it only occurs after the previous write is flushed. I don't think this helps but it's not a bad idea.
- :rocket: uses the `split` module in the parent/orchestrating process to (hopefully) only write whole-line chunks to the output file

### v11.0.0

- :rocket: ITP segments are now allowed to exceeds the min/max addresses at the calculated start/end points to get a better range
    - IE: `22 => 96` would potentially become `0 => 100`.
    - Although this doesn't change the output format or cli options the data is drastically different from the 10x series - hence the major version

### v10.0.1

### v9.22.1

- :rocket: Remove outdated getNames() call

### v9.22.0

- :rocket: Show street name of viewed feature
- :rocket: Allow searching by lat/lng in search box

### v9.21.1

- :bug: bugfix for zero-distance results in `test.js` mode

- :rocket: Reduced the value of the distance in ST_clusterWithin used for network and address clusters, to prevent roads and points far away from each other from being clustered together

### v9.20.0

- :white_check_mark: Add tests for hooked roads
- :rocket: Take highest/lowest number off end of road into consideration when generating ITP

- :rocket: Add in memory number limits

### v9.19.0

- :rocket: Limit precision of coordinates to avoid `NUMERIC` overflows
- :rocket: `number` (civic address) are only allowed to be 10 chars long to reduce bad data - can bump in the future if needed
- :rocket: Unnamed large streets are allowed
- :tada: Add CONTRIBUTING doc to ensure versions are bumped
- :bug: Ensure output of test is prefixed to working dir

### v9.18.0

- :tada: Add diacritic handling to both the test mode & std. `street` field
- rocket: Use `address._text` as definitive name and add `network._text` as syn when they differ
- :bug: Make `psv` files in `lib/copy` have unique names so pt2itp can run in parallel
- :rocket: `test` mode now outputs when network and address text differ as an error

### v9.16.0

- :bug: Allow `debug` mode from any relative path - use to break as `./web` was hardcoded as static dir
- :tada: remove all `freq` calculations and replace with a much more accurate Liechtenstein distance percent.
  - This change is pretty large and will drastically affect matches in all countries.
  - Before matches were calculated by sorting potentials with the calculated frequency of token matches. This worked well if everything was spelled correctly and helped ensure `st` vs `av` errors still lead to a match. It did however also allow things like `Margaret St` and `Shepherd St` to match on the `ST` token alone.
  - This uses lev. dist to generate a percent with a hard cutoff on if the match can take place or not. From a lot of groking the results 40% matches and above seem like a good first start.
